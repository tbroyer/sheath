Sheath: Dagger Inside
=====================

A proof-of-concept adapter for using [Dagger][1] with [GWT][2].

Currently, the code generated by Dagger itself is leveraged as much as possible.
This leads to suboptimal GWT code: many things done at runtime that could have been done
at compile time, probably doesn't play well with code splitting, etc.
